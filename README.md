# Foxit Sentinel Pro 🛡️

> **Securely orchestrate high-value agreements with AI validation, Foxit PDF watermarking, and an immutable audit ledger.**

Foxit Sentinel Pro is an auditable agreement orchestrator that automates the lifecycle of high-value contracts. It combines AI-driven data injection with Foxit's powerful PDF manipulation services to create a "glass pipeline" for legal documents—where every action is verified, logged, and cryptographically secured.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Autofill 🤖

Uses AI (simulated via regex/NLP patterns for demo) to parse deal context and instantly inject entity details (e.g., "Wayne Enterprises", "Gotham City") into complex legal templates like NDAs and MSAs.

### 2. Foxit-Powered Security 🔒

Leverages the **Foxit PDF Services API** to:

- **Dynamic Watermarking:** Applies context-aware overlays (e.g., "CONFIDENTIAL - ID: [Hash]") to generated documents.
- **Linearization:** Optimizes PDFs for "Fast Web View," enabling instant byte-streaming for large contracts.

### 3. Immutable Audit Ledger 📜

Every action—from template selection to final generation—is cryptographically hashed and logged in a side-by-side "Ledger" interface. This allows stakeholders to verify exactly when a document was processed and that its integrity remains intact.
